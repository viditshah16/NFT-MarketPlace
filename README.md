# NFT-MarketPlace

This is a fullstack DApp NFT Marketplace built as a study project to learn more about blockchain and smart contract development.  
Made with Nextjs, IPFS, Hardhat, OpenZeppelin, Ethers, Tailwind.

I worked on the following: 
- Setting up the DApp development environment
- Create a Nextjs app using the create-next-app utility to recompose the React library
- Compile and Deploy Smart Contracts to Blockchain with Hardhat functionality
- Implementing industry standard NFT smart contracts for DApps with the ERC721 OpenZeppelin Contracts
- Using functional programming to maintain DApp state
- IPFS data hosting with Infura Blockchain Suite Project Management
- Implementing an NFT Minting form on the front end to lock in Metadata and Files for the DApp
- Looping, iterating, and filtering through hash tables with Javascript and Solidity
- Modern Card Design and UI with Tailwind and CSS
- Hooking up a web3 provider to the Polygon and Ethereum network
- And much more along the way!
